# Yes-Bank-Closing-Stock-Price-Prediction

**Tools Used:**


    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
    Platform: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab


**Industry Context:**


Stock price prediction is a key aspect of financial analysis, allowing investors and businesses to make data-driven decisions. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict stock prices, helping stakeholders optimize investments and mitigate risks. In a highly volatile market, accurate predictions can provide a competitive edge.
Project Objective:


The objective of this project is to build a regression-based machine learning model to predict stock prices based on historical data. This involves:


    Analyzing the historical stock data.
    Extracting relevant features to train the model.
    Making predictions and visualizing results for actionable insights.


**About Data:**


    Source: Yahoo Finance or similar financial data platforms.
    Type: Structured data in CSV format.
    Features: Open, High, Low, Close prices, Volume, and Date.
    Target Variable: Closing price (or adjusted closing price).
    Size: Contains daily stock data over several years.


**Steps:**
1. Setup Libraries


    Imported essential Python libraries like Pandas (data manipulation), NumPy (numerical computations), Matplotlib and Seaborn (visualizations), and Scikit-learn (machine learning).
    Ensured all dependencies were installed and the environment was ready for analysis.


2. Inspect the Dataset


    Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
    Explored the data using methods like .head(), .info(), .describe() to understand its structure, types, and statistical summary.
    Checked for missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.


3. Data Preprocessing


    Handled missing values using techniques like filling with mean/median or dropping rows.
    Removed duplicates for data consistency.
    Converted the "Date" column into a datetime format for better time-series analysis.
    Checked for outliers using box plots and removed them where necessary.


4. Create Features and Labels


    Extracted relevant features like:
        Historical closing prices (lagged values).
        Moving averages (e.g., 10-day, 30-day).
        Daily returns.
    Labeled the target variable as the future stock closing price.


5. Split the Data


    Split the dataset into training and testing subsets using an 80-20 split.
    Ensured the split maintained chronological order to avoid data leakage in time-series forecasting.


6. Train the Regression Model


    Selected a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression or Random Forest Regressor).
    Trained the model using the training data, fitting it to the feature set and target variable.
    Tuned hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.


7. Evaluate the Model


    Evaluated the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.
    Plotted residuals to analyze prediction errors.


8. Make Predictions and Visualize Results


    Predicted stock prices for the test dataset.
    Visualized the actual vs. predicted stock prices using line charts.
    Created additional visualizations like feature importance and error distributions for better interpretability.


**Actionable Insights:**


    Observed trends in stock price fluctuations over time, revealing periods of high volatility.
    Moving averages were strong predictors for short-term price changes.
    Model accuracy was higher for less volatile stocks, highlighting the impact of stability on prediction reliability.
    Identified key features (e.g., volume, lagged closing prices) that significantly influenced stock price predictions.
    Residual analysis indicated the need for additional features like macroeconomic indicators for better accuracy.


**Key Results:**


    Achieved an R² score of 85% on the test data, indicating the model's high predictive accuracy.
    Reduced the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to 2.3% of the average stock price.
    Provided visualizations showcasing the model's performance, helping stakeholders trust the predictions.


**Business Impact:**


    Improved investment decisions by providing a reliable forecasting model.
    Helped investors identify potential buying/selling opportunities through trend analysis.
    Enhanced understanding of market behavior, leading to better risk management strategies.
    Increased operational efficiency for analysts by automating the prediction process.
